    <h2>A classic hamburger is a simple yet satisfying dish that combines a juicy beef patty with fresh toppings and a toasted bun. Perfect for quick meals, barbecues, or casual gatherings, hamburgers are endlessly customizable to suit your taste. The tender, seasoned patty pairs beautifully with crisp lettuce, ripe tomatoes, and melted cheese, while condiments like ketchup, mustard, or mayonnaise add the perfect finishing touch. Easy to prepare and universally loved, a homemade hamburger brings comfort and flavor to any table.</h2>
    <h1>ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
        <li>slices of cheese (cheddar, American, or your choice)</li>
        <li>Lettuce leaves</li>
        <li>1 large tomato, sliced</li>
        <li>1 small red onion, thinly sliced (optional)</li>
        <li>Pickles (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Burger Patties: In a bowl, mix ground beef (80% lean, 20% fat) with salt, pepper, and optional seasonings like garlic powder or smoked paprika. Divide the mixture into equal portions and shape into patties slightly larger than your buns.</li>
        <li>Cook the Patties: Heat a skillet, grill, or griddle over medium-high heat. Cook the patties for 3-5 minutes per side, depending on your desired level of doneness. Add a slice of cheese on top during the last minute of cooking if desired.</li>
        <li>Toast the Buns: Lightly butter the inside of hamburger buns and toast them in a skillet or on the grill until golden and slightly crispy.</li>
        <li>Assemble the Hamburger: Spread condiments (like ketchup, mustard, or mayonnaise) on the bottom bun. Add lettuce, a slice of tomato, the cooked patty, and optional toppings like onions, pickles, or bacon. Place the top bun on to complete the burger.</li>
        <li>Serve and Enjoy: Serve the hamburgers with a side of fries, chips, or a fresh salad. Customize your burger with additional toppings like avocado, sautéed mushrooms, or jalapeños for extra flavor.</li>
    </ol>
