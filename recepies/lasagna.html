  <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="../img/lasanga.jpg" alt="lasagna" width="310" height="310">
    <h3>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that layers rich flavors and hearty ingredients to create a satisfying meal. To make a traditional lasagna, start by preparing a savory meat sauce with ground beef or Italian sausage, sautéed onions, garlic, and a robust tomato sauce seasoned with oregano, basil, and a hint of red pepper flakes. Simultaneously, prepare a creamy cheese mixture by combining ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheese with an egg and a sprinkle of parsley for added flavor. Layer the lasagna noodles—either pre-cooked or oven-ready—with alternating layers of meat sauce and cheese mixture in a baking dish, finishing with a generous topping of mozzarella. Bake the lasagna at 375°F (190°C) for about 45 minutes, covering it with foil for the first half of the baking time to prevent excessive browning. Once golden and bubbling, let the lasagna rest for a few minutes before serving to allow the layers to set. Perfect for family dinners or special gatherings, this dish is both comforting and indulgent.</h3>
