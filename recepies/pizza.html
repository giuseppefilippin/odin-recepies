    <h1>steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Dough: In a bowl, combine warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for 5 minutes until frothy. Add flour, salt, and olive oil, mixing until a dough forms. Knead for 8-10 minutes until smooth. Cover and let rise for 1-2 hours until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Assemble the Pizza: Roll out the dough on a floured surface into your desired shape. Transfer to a baking sheet or pizza stone. Spread the tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border for the crust. Add shredded mozzarella cheese and your chosen toppings.</li>
        <li>Bake and Serve: Preheat the oven to 475°F (245°C). Bake the pizza for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly. Remove from the oven, slice, and serve hot. Enjoy!</li>
